## Overview

This is a work-in-progress full-stack MERN template.

For the client side, I am using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired#readme) to have custom functionality with my [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project.

For the server-side I am using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

To use this template, simply clone the whole thing and install the client and server dependencies. Then run your server, and run the client as well to interact between the two. Use this is a starting point from which to build any front-end you wish to interact with any API you build on the back-end.

Out of the box you will have a basic interface and an API for CRUD operations to manage users and admin tasks, as well as authentication and authorization.
